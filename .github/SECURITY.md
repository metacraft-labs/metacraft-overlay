# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in these packages, please report it to us in one of the ways described below:

- Open a [GitHub security issue](https://github.com/metacraft-labs/metacraft-overlay/security/advisories/new). **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
- Reach us at <security@codetracer.com>

You should receive a response within 7 days. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Scope

A "vulnerability in CodeTracer" is a vulnerability in the code distributed through our main source code repository on GitHub. Vulnerabilities that are specific to a given installation (e.g. misconfiguration) should be reported to the owner of that installation and not us.

## Rewards

At the moment, we cannot offer any cash bounties for the reported vulnerabilities, regardless of their severity.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Metacraft Labs follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/documents/1945/2017_003_001_503340.pdf).

Thank you for helping keep CodeTracer users safe!
